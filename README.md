# Encryption-and-Decryption
In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. This tool will take the text from the user and will encrypt the text and ask them if they are willing to decrypt the text or not. It also has the functionality to save the output into the text file.

Installation
---------------------
